<h1>How to chage Firefox language</h1>
<p>I am very sorry. There no a &quot;language setting&quot; in Firefox setting(ver 42.0).</p>
<p>If you want to change your Firefox language, there have some methon:</p>
<p>Uninstall Firefox but uncheck delete user data and intall a new Firefox with the language you want. :-)</p>
<p>or...(this methon is a litter hard)</p>
<p>1.goto <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools">here</a> and install the language pack you want, just click Install Language Pack is OK.(if Firefox tell you <span disabled="">&quot;Not available for Firefox&quot;</span>, goto Version Information on the buttom, chick &quot;See complete version history&quot; and choose your version to install.)</p>
<p>2.Type &quot;about:config&quot; to address bar in your Firefox. Change &quot;general.useragent.locale&quot; to your location.(such as:en-US,zh-TW)</p>
<p>3.Restart your Firefox.</p>
<p>btw, if you want to change the language of your add-ons, you can change &quot;intl.locale.matchOS&quot; to true.</p>
<p>I do this and successful change my Firefox language to English. If you have any question, email me, I will do my best to help you :-)</p>
